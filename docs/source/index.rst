Welcome to Lambda Model Zoo!
=====================================

Lambda Model Zoo is a curate of easy-to-use, high performance, open-source machine learning solutions: 

* We understand machine learning boilplate can be boring to write and hard to maintain. For this reason we've isoloated the core algrithms from the rest of the code so you can focus on designing the best machine leanring models.

* We understand keeping up with the rapidly-evolving machine learning frameworks and APIs can be difficult. So we've designed very carefully a set of resuable, maintainable modules as the building blocks for machine learning solutions. You can create novel solutions by simply composing these building blocks. 

* We believe transfer learning is the key to efficient research and development. That is why we focus on models that have stood the test of time and make it extremely easy to apply these models to your own problems.
